      <h1>Welcome to Alec's portfolio!</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio! I'm currently a sophomore at NYU and doing a joint major in Computer Science and Economics.</p>
      <p> I was born in Switzerland and am also Colombian and American. I'm a big fan of sports (soccer, NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL) and am also growing my interest in cooking and baking.</p>
      <p> I love memes so don't be suprised to see a lot of memes here.</p>
      <p> Here is a list of my favorite projects that I've done:
          Virtual Moped Project
          Binary Search Tree Balancer
          Tic Counter

          I plan on making an app game about Le Monke.</p>
