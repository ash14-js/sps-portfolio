      <h1>Welcome to Alec's portfolio!</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio! I'm currently a sophomore at NYU and doing a joint major in Computer Science and Economics.</p>
      <p> I was born in Switzerland and am also Colombian and American. I'm a big fan of sports (soccer, NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL) and am also growing my interest in cooking and baking.</p>
      <p> I love memes so don't be suprised to see a lot of memes here.</p>
      <p> Here is a list of my favorite projects that I've done: 
          Virtual Moped Project,
          Binary Search Tree Balancer,
          Tic Counter. 

           I plan on making an app game about Le Monke.</p>

      <p> Here are my favorite places: </p>
      <img src = "/images/dolomites.jpg">
      <p> The Dolomites are my paradise. They are a registered UNISCO World Heritage Site and I have a lot of fond memories from my experiences there.</p>
      <img src = "/images/nyc.jpg">
      <p> I grew up in NYC and it is my favorite city in the world. It has given me many valuable opportunities and experiences.
      <img src = "/images/levain.jpg">
      <p> Levains Bakery has the best cookies in NYC. 10/10 recommend.</p>
      <img src = "/images/elongatedmuskrat.jpg">
      <p> Elon Musk's work ethic and genius is really inspiring.</p>
      <p> My hidden talent is being insanely double jointed. I can pull my thumb backwards and do other crazy things. I don't even know how to describe them, so just ask me in person and I'll demonstrate!
          My other "talent" is being able to almost instantly recognize a fake jersey vs a real jersey. I have a collection of over 50 jerseys and also help people do legit checks on their jerseys. Jersey collecting is
          one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
